# dotconfig-sane-defaults
Sane Defaults for your dotconfig files

Add your (hopefully) sane defaults for dotconfig files here. Each user can have their own folder based on their username. The default dotconfig file will be `_.<extension>` as there are not any users on Github with the username `_`.

## Contributing

1. In the `sane-defaults` folder, locate or create a folder with the name of the dotconfig that you want to add. 
2. Either make a PR to change the file `_` (the default) or create a file called `<your-username>.<extension>`. 
3. Profit
